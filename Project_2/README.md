# Hi, Welcome to this project

## This real dataset we're exploring is about US gas prices. The data comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).


### Initial Analisis:


Data Meaning:

*  fuel: The type of fuel reported (gasoline or diesel).
*  grade: The grade or specification of the fuel (for gasoline: all, regular, midgrade, or premium; for diesel: all, ultra_low_sulfur, low_sulfur).
*  formulation: The formulation of the gasoline (all, conventional, or reformulated). Only applies to gasoline.
*  price: The average U.S. retail price per gallon in U.S. dollars for that fuel type.
*  day, month, year: The day-week-year-ending date for the reported fuel price.

  
Key points:

KEY: I discovered all the null values where 'diesel' fuel type. I deleted that variable, know i just have'gasoline' as fuel type.

*  I have 19, 672 entries with 7 columns.
*  I have 7 different variables including (fuel, grade, formulation, price and date.)
*  I have data from 1990 to 2025.
*  I have four different grades.
*  I have three types of formulation
*  Price variable go from 0.885 to 6.064 USD
